                This garden is 121 years old, created by Jennie Butchart with help from her husband. 
                She created a beautiful garden from a previous limestone quarry. Which 121 years 
                later has bloomed into the beautiful landscape seen in the image above and popular tourist site.

            <p>Entering a small tunnel surounded by bushes, there is a little court, surrounded by buildings. The focal point 
                of this section in the gardens is the massive foutain covered in lilypads
                lines with bunches of pink and purple flowers. All the buildings are covered in growing 
                plants. The whole section is very clean and kept more particular then the rest of the 
                gardens.
